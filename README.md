# Tip-calculator

the purpose of this project was for me to practice javascript. I was assigned this assignment from one of my courses. and the whole goal was to work with arrays, have this data assign to certain people. also having the data work together to come to an end result which was what I wrote in my web app.

A calculator to set your settings for how much you want to tip for each restaurant bill you enter
